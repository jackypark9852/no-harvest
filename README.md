## STORY
There is a **secret** lurking in the private properties of the **Fields of Serialization**...

As the **God of Harvests**, you are disturbed by the suspicious surge in the number of harvests between the unholy days of the sixth and the ninth of the first month of the 2023rd year. "Where did all of these harvests come from?" you ponder.

Enraged and determined to preserve the ~sacred~ harvest equilibrium, you embark on a painfully necessary journey to destroy the plague of fruitful harvest. It's just like a deep quote you remember: the hardest choices require the strongest wills. "Where did I hear that from again?" you ponder.

The fate of the force of the harvest lies in your hands. How long can you keep the equilibrium?

## HOW TO PLAY
- Select a natural disaster from the menu, then select tiles on the board to destroy plants, then click OK.
- If more than half of the entire board is half full of plants, you lose!
- Beware! Some plants are immune to certain elements and can spawn additional plant copies, so plan your attack wisely with the right natural disasters every turn!

Comment below what day you reached!
